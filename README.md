I've added an in-depth [design guide](https://github.com/whollender/SuperAudioBoard/blob/master/SuperAudioBoardDesignGuide.pdf) that walks through the design of the board. I'm currently working on a usage guide, but don't have it ready just yet.

A good place to start is the [Hackaday project page](https://hackaday.io/project/5912-teensy-super-audio-board).

The [forum thread](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/27215-24-bit-audio-boards) is another good place for more information.

All design files are in this repo.  Here are a few quick links:
* the [schematic](https://github.com/whollender/SuperAudioBoard/blob/master/SuperAudioBoard_Schematic.pdf)
* the [BOM](https://github.com/whollender/SuperAudioBoard/blob/master/SuperAudioBoard_BOM.csv)


The files under SineTestCode are example code to get the board up and running with a Teensy 3.x
[This file](https://github.com/whollender/SuperAudioBoard/blob/master/sine_test.hex) is the compiled test code that can be downloaded directly to a Teensy for testing.

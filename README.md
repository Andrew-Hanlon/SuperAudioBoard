I don't have a lot of documentation written up at the moment, so the best places to start would be:
* the [forum thread](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/27215-24-bit-audio-boards) describing the board and its development
* the [schematic](https://github.com/whollender/SuperAudioBoard/blob/master/SuperAudioBoard_Schematic.pdf)
* the [BOM](https://github.com/whollender/SuperAudioBoard/blob/master/SuperAudioBoard_BOM.csv)
